      \item[Client side]
        I have experience, from both my time at Ericsson Research and from hobby projects,
        in developing responsive, data-intensive applications
        with modern web technologies.

        Experience with MV* frameworks, mainly
        AngularJS (favorite) and Backbone.js. Layout and design; media queries
        transitions and animations, Twitter Bootstrap.
      \item[Server side]
        I like to work with Node.js and Express.js with mongodb or other NoSQL databases.
        I often employ socket.io (websockets) for real-time communication.

        Experience in using integrated authentication via Facebook and and other authentication
        providers.

        Familiarity with Ruby on Rails, Django, PHP and related services
        and technologies.

        Experience with cloud-hosting on PaaS'es, mainly working with Heroku.

      \item[JavaScript] Currently my favorite language, have written lots of code
        in JS. Also accustomed to CoffeeScript and dialects. See above section for
        more details regarding web technologies, and my \href{http://viktorq.se}{website} for projects.
      \item[Python] My first language, currently not coding actively but still very comfortable.
      \item[Bash] Simple scripts and automated system maintenance. See for example my
        \href{https://github.com/ViktorQvarfordt/automated-incremental-backups}{automated backup-system}
        implemented in bash.
      \item[Matlab] Data analysis and numerical methods, object oriented Matlab.
      \item[C++] Basic knowledge, one 7.5 ECTS course.
      \item[Misc.] Scheme and dialects of Lisp. Some familiarity (so far mainly fascination) with
        Haskell and other functional languages. Comfortable with Regular Expressions.
    \end{list}

  \item[Numerical methods and analysis] Comfortable implementing numerical methods for solving
    differential equations; Runge Kutta and others. Besides Matlab and Mathematica I have used
    the Python modules SciPy and NumPy, Sage. Experience in statistical analysis of large
    sets of data collected from experiments.

  \item[Misc.]
    \emph{Version management}: Git, Mercurial. \,\,
    \emph{Digital typesetting}: \LaTeX, \XeTeX and friends. \,\,
