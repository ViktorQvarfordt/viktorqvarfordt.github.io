			<h2>Experience</h2>

			<p>
				Currently employed
				at the
				<a class="smooth-link" href="http://www.math.su.se/">Department of Mathematics</a>
				as a
				<a class="smooth-link" href="http://sukat.su.se/person.jsp?dn=uid%3Dviqv8695%2Cdc%3Dmath%2Cdc%3Dsu%2Cdc%3Dse">Teaching Assistant</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				At Ericsson Research I developed real-time web applications as a
				Researcher within the Multi-Media Technologies group,
				full time during the summer 2013.
			</p>

			<p>
				Previous semesters I have worked as a Private Teacher
				for upper secondary school (gymnasium) students and as a
				Substitute Teacher at various upper secondary schools.
			</p>

			<p>
				I enjoy writing code, most of my recent projects tend to fall under the category of real-time web apps.
				See more below.

			<h2>Education</h2>

			<p>
				Studying mathematics and the <span title=":)">universe...</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				This semester I am taking courses in both theoretical and experimental
				Quantum Mechanics along with a course in Foundations of Mathematical Analysis.
			</p>

			<p>
				I am taking part in the Bachelor's Program in Physics
				in parallel with the BSc Program in Mathematics.
				I will be writing my thesis next semester, after which I will continue my studies at graduate level.

 		<h2>Projects & Ideas</h2>

 		<p>
			This is a list of some of my projects and ideas for future projects, see my <a href="https://github.com/ViktorQvarfordt?tab=repositories">Github</a> profile for more, and source code.
 		</p>

 		<ul>
 			<li>
 				<strong><a href="http://livehtml.viktorq.se/">livehtml.viktorq.se</a></strong> –
 				Really real-time collaborative editor with live HTML, CSS and JS preview.
 				Allows you to build and collaborate on HTML documents with instant syncing and rendering.
 			</li>
 			<li>
 				<strong><a href="http://latexchat.com">latexchat.com</a></strong> – A web-based chat with
 				instant LaTeX-rendering capabilities. The application contains a real-time interface of all chats,
 				sorted by time of last post and filtered by status. Another very important feature is, of course,
 				displaying presence of users; in the chat interface you see who else is currently in that particular chat
 				and in the start view you see all online users.
 			</li>
 			<li>
 				<strong><a href="http://notes.viktorq.se">notes.viktorq.se</a></strong> – A project demonstrating
 				live-rendering of markdown and easy publishing.
 				Motivation for the project was that I felt there where no way to instantly publish content
 				on the web transparently without any hassle. This site slides out an editor on keypress and instantly
 				allows to edit the content, with live preview.
 			</li>
 			<li>
 				<strong><a href="http://sharemath.viktorq.se">sharemath.viktorq.se</a></strong> – Real-time collaboration
 				on a document. The purpose is to demonstrate real-time rendering of LaTeX with no flickering.
 				This is early development / will serve as basis for other projects.
 			</li>
 			<li>
 				<strong><a href="https://github.com/ViktorQvarfordt/automated-incremental-backups">Automated Incremental Backups</a></strong> –
 				My automatic backup-solution, implemented entirely in bash.
 			</li>
 			<li>
 				<strong><a href="https://github.com/ViktorQvarfordt/auto-tex-compile">Auto TeX Compile</a></strong> –
 				Automatically re-render latex-document when writing to source file (saving document from editor).
 				The program automatically runs tex-compiler as many times as needed for references etc. to show correctly.
 			</li>
 			<li>
 				<strong>Opus</strong> – Idea for future project, crowd-sourced music database (mainly intended for classical works).
 				The service will provide powerful search capabilities, easily finding and sorting data. Interface to existing data from for example Wikipedia.
 				The service will also provide integrated streaming from external (legal) services. A mapping to <a href="http://imslp.org/">imslp.org</a> for sheet music.
 			</li>
 			<li>
 				<strong>Real-time Content Management System / Live site</strong> –
 				An experiment for a really-real time instant publishing CMS.
 			</li>
 			<li>
 				<strong>Slideshow as a service</strong> – Super easy web-based powerful slide shows, with latex rendering of course.
 			</li>
 			<li>
 				<strong>Linear Scalable Calendar</strong> – Idea for new style of calendar interface. My brain is not
 				always compatible with weeks and moths; I want an interface where everything is on a horizontal strip
 				that can be stretched horizontally to show larger or shorter time-spans, and stretched vertically to show
 				more or less details. And of course, calendar can be slided horizontally. This project is on delay until
 				I find time for it.
 			</li>
 			<li>
 				<strong>Disordered todos/notes</strong> – Todo-lists normally enforce ordering in a list-like structure.
 				I want to explore the the opposite where tasks/notes live on a canvas (with some level of depth) where
 				everything is arbitrarily movable, somewhat looking like a mind map. This will be web-based.
 			</li>
 		</ul>

 		<h3>Technologies I use</h3>

 		<p>
 			I like to work with <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and
 			<a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> on the server
 			with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">mongodb</a> or other
 			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a> databases.

 			I often employ <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> (websockets) for real-time communication.
 			In many cases I use the service <a href="http://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>
 			as real-time backend solution.

 			On the client-side I very much enjoy using <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> as MV* framework.
