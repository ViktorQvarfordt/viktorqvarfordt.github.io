      <h2>Experience</h2>

      <p>Currently employed at the <a class="smooth-link" href="http://www.math.su.se/">Department of Mathematics</a> as <a class="smooth-link" href="http://sukat.su.se/person.jsp?dn=uid%3Dviqv8695%2Cdc%3Dmath%2Cdc%3Dsu%2Cdc%3Dse">Teaching Assistant</a>, where I also work on web-based solutions for improving online education.</p>

      <p>At Ericsson Research I developed real-time web applications as a Researcher within the Multi-Media Technologies group, full time during the summer 2013.</p>

      <p>Previous semesters I have worked as a Private Teacher for upper secondary school (gymnasium) students and as a Substitute Teacher at various upper secondary schools.</p>

      <p>I enjoy writing code, especially web applications, see more below.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>

      <p>Studying mathematics and physics at Stockholm University.</p>

      <p>I am  currently writing my bachelor thesis on the topic of Quantum Graphs.</p>

      <p>During the summer 2014 I will attend the summer programme at DESY, hamburg.</p>

      <p>My main academic interests are mainly mathematical / theoretical physics and pure mathematics. However, I have also taken courses in Computer Science and Economics.</p>

    <h2>Some other stuff</h2>

    <h3>Web development – Technologies I use</h3>

    <p>Strong opponent of putting client side MVC solutions, the server is merely a datastore providing a REST API (with websockets if real time communication is desired).</p>

    <p>I like to work with <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> on the server with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">mongodb</a> or other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a> databases.</p>

    <p>On the client-side I very much enjoy using <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> as MV* framework. Recently I have also started using Ember, which I find very exciting.</p>

    <h3>Web development – Projects i want to implement</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Continuous group scheduler</strong> – Like doodle but participants specify continuous time intervals where they are available (also allow to specify if-need-be time).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Linear continuously scalable calendar</strong> – Idea for new style of calendar interface. Structuring time in weeks and months is not always not optimal; to get a more intuitive way of interacting with the calendar I want an interface where everything is on a horizontal strip that can be stretched horizontally to show larger or shorter time-spans, and stretched vertically to show more or less details. And of course, the calendar can be slided horizontally to show different time intervals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Opus</strong> – Crowd-sourced music database (mainly intended for classical works). The idea is to create a well structured collection of metadata of all (primarily) classical works, with links to external resources for audio files and sheet music. The service will provide powerful search capabilities, easily finding and sorting data. Initially data can be mined from Wikipedia. The service may also provide integrated streaming from external (legal) services. A mapping to <a href="http://imslp.org/">imslp.org</a> for sheet music.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Slideshow as a service</strong> – Such things already exist. I want to optimize for my use case, make it completely open and portable. Native support for latex math rendering (via mathjax) for nice looking presentations with mathematics. Super-easy web-based interface for creating / managing slides while still allowing flexible templating and specifying slides data as json.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Really-real time Content Management System / Live site</strong> – An experiment for a really-real time instant publishing CMS based on websockets.
      </li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Web development – Existing open sourced projects</h3>

    <p>This is a list of some of my web development hobby projects, see my <a href="https://github.com/ViktorQvarfordt?tab=repositories">Github</a> profile for more, and source code.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="http://livehtml.viktorq.se/">livehtml.viktorq.se</a></strong> –
        Really real-time collaborative editor with live HTML, CSS and JS preview.
        Allows you to build and collaborate on HTML documents with instant syncing and rendering.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="http://latexchat.com">latexchat.com</a></strong> – A web-based chat with
        instant LaTeX-rendering capabilities. The application contains a real-time interface of all chats,
        sorted by time of last post and filtered by status. Another very important feature is, of course,
        displaying presence of users; in the chat interface you see who else is currently in that particular chat
        and in the start view you see all online users.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="http://notes.viktorq.se">notes.viktorq.se</a></strong> – A project demonstrating
        live-rendering of markdown and easy publishing.
        Motivation for the project was that I felt there where no way to instantly publish content
        on the web transparently without any hassle. This site slides out an editor on keypress and instantly
        allows to edit the content, with live preview.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="http://sharemath.viktorq.se">sharemath.viktorq.se</a></strong> – Real-time collaboration
        on a document. The purpose is to demonstrate real-time rendering of LaTeX with no flickering.
        This is early development / will serve as basis for other projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/ViktorQvarfordt/auto-tex-compile">Auto TeX Compile</a></strong> –
        Automatically re-render latex-document when writing to source file (saving document from editor).
        The program automatically runs tex-compiler as many times as needed for references etc. to show correctly.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Programming – miscellaneous</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/ViktorQvarfordt/automated-incremental-backups">Automated Incremental Backups</a></strong> – My automatic backup-solution, implemented entirely in bash.
      </li>
    </ul>
