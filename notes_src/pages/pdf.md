# Manipulating pdf files

`pdftk` does merging, splitting, meta data manipulations and other fancy things.

## pdf→svg

```
pdfcrop --hires input.pdf output.pdf && pdf2svg output.pdf output.svg
```

See also [this page](latex/minimal) for notes on making minimal pdf documents with latex (no margins, page numbers etc).

## Extract images from pdf

[Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) is the solution to most things dealing with vector graphics (which is what pdf's mostly are), although it can also be used to extract ordinary images from pdfs.

Also pdf to svg should be achievable directly with Inkscape.
